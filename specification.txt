## Character information box.

A box to display the character information. This should have a distinct background and a minimum size even while empty. It will contain an img for the current character profile, a button which will add the current character to the team if there is room, a button which will display additional information, and a section for additional information.

## Input section

The input section, which will have a dropdown list of every marvel character, populated by the API. Also a box for text input. Also a button which will check the api for any value in the textbox, unless there is none in which case it will default to the value of the dropdown. This would be a good place for some basic instructions. Yes, you can add the same character twice. This is comic books.

## Team section

The team section, which will contain five other sections. Each other section will display a character's picture and name. Each section will have a button which will remove the current character from the team. Anyone who isn't a team leader will have a button which makes them the leader.

## Functions

Populate the dropdown. Asynchronous. No paramater. Generates a TS. Uses that to make a hash. Makes a request to the API for the list of all character names. Iterates over that list to create options and append them to the dropdown menu. Randomizes the starting location of the dropdown menu. In the event of failure it appends a single option saying please use text field. If possible, it changes the Submit button to only look at the text.

Get the character object. Asyncronous. It takes a name as a parameter. It gets a timestamp, creates a hash, and uses both to make the request. It returns the character object.

Clear info box. No parameters. It checks if there is any info in the character information box and removes it all.

Clear team member. Takes a div as a parameter. Checks if there are currently five team members. If so, it enables the current Join button, if it exists. Removes the div from the team list.

Make team leader. Takes a div as a parameter. Checks if a team leader exists, and if so, removes the Leader class from that person. Regardless, adds the leader class to the div of the argument.

More Info addition. Takes an object as a parameter. Adds more information. What specifically it adds will be determined later.

Append character to info box. It takes a character object as a parameter. First it runs the function to clear the info box. Then it adds the current object's img to the profile pic. Then it adds the current object's name. Then it creates a Join Team button. If there are five members of the team, it starts disabled. Then it creates a More Info button.

Add to team. Takes an object. Creates a team-class div using the profile image and photo of the object. Creates Remove and Make Leader buttons.

## Listener Events

Submit name. If the text box has a value, grabs the value. If it does not, checks the dropdown. If the value of the dropdown is "Dropdown not working" it alerts the user to enter a name before clicking sumbit. Otherwise it takes the value from the dropdown. Then it gets the character objects from the value, and appends character to info box.

Add to team. Calls the 'add to team' function, passing it the object as a parameter.

More info. Calls the More Info function, passing the object as a parameter.

Remove. Runs the Clear Team Member function, with its own div as the parameter.

Make leader. Runs the Make Leader function with the div it's a part of as the argument.
